Describe the data flow for this use case in the following form:
When the app first starts, the user sees...
The frontend sends a [GET/PUT/...] request to the backend with body ...
The backend returns a response with body ...
The frontend displays ... to the user
The user performs the following input: ...
The frontend sends a [GET/PUT/...] request to the backend with body ...
Etc.



Decide what components should exist in the frontend, what behaviours each should have, and how each should appear when rendered.


Write the code for the components. You will need to decide where in the lifecycle of the component each behavior should take place, whether data should be represented by props or states, and whether the component should be a class or a hook (information about this coming in the lectures).
