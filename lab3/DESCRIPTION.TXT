Describe the data flow for this use case in the following form:
When the app first starts, the user sees...
    The top should be a navbar with relevant links and a hamburger button if screen is small.
    The user should see a banner video or image wiht some sort of CTA.
    The user should see a section of relevant or popular products after the banner.
    Then some copyrighty things like zalando. Just repeating sections of different categories to give the customer ideas.
    Then We come to the footer.
    

The frontend sends a [GET/PUT/...] request to the backend with body ...
    GET needs either relevant products or popular products when start site.
The backend returns a response with body ...
    List of products
The frontend displays ... to the user
    grid of products
The user performs the following input: ...
    add to cart
The frontend sends a [GET/PUT/...] request to the backend with body ...
Etc.
    session



Decide what components should exist in the frontend, what behaviours each should have, and how each should appear when rendered.


Write the code for the components. You will need to decide where in the lifecycle of the component each behavior should take place, whether data should be represented by props or states, and whether the component should be a class or a hook (information about this coming in the lectures).
