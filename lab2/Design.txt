Design

1. Model - What classes and objects should exist in our model?
---Did without sketching

2. Services - What operations do we need to perform on these entities?

---Add product, remove product, restock product, get products,

3. Controllers - Which requests should the server accept? 
   For each request, which of the operations we 
   identified in question 2 should it perform, and what 
   response should it send back to the browser?

   POST request to /products/ with proper description given 
   that it's not duplicate will return 201 Created response, 
   302 Found if alreadyy present and 400 bad request if request is wrong
   
   GET  request from /products/ should get the list of all 
   products and send a 200 OK response

   PUT request to /products/?id should update the stock of the product
   given that the product exists and the request is sent in a correct way.
   This will return a 200 OK response then, a 400 Bad Request if faulty request
   and 404 Not Found if item is not found.

   DELETE request /products/?id should remove the product
   given that the product exists and the request is sent in a correct way.
   This will return a 200 OK response then, a 400 Bad Request if faulty request
   and 404 Not Found if item is not found.
